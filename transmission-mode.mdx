Transmission mode adalah mekanisme transfer/pertukaran data antara dua devices pada suatu network. Mode ini merupakan mode bagaimana arus pertukaran suatu data. Terdapat 3 jenis mode transmisi:

- Simplex Mode
- Half Duplex Mode
- Full Duplex Mode

## Perbedaan Antar Jenis Mode Transmisi

| No. | Parameters                         | **Simplex**                                                                                             | **Half Duplex**                                                                                                                | **Full Duplex**                                                                                                                   |

| 1.  | The **direction** of communication | Simplex mode is a uni-directional communication.                                                        | Half Duplex mode is a two-way directional communication but one at a time.                                                     | Full Duplex mode is a two-way directional communication simultaneously.                                                           |
| 2.  | **Sender** and **Receiver**        | In simplex mode, Sender can send the data but that sender can&#8217;t receive the data.                 | In Half Duplex mode, Sender can send the data and also can receive the data but one at a time.                                 | In Full Duplex mode, Sender can send the data and also can receive the data simultaneously.                                       |
| 3.  | **Channel** usage                  | Usage of one channel for the transmission of data.                                                      | Usage of one channel for the transmission of data.                                                                             | Usage of two channels for the transmission of data.                                                                               |
| 4.  | **Performance**                    | The simplex mode provides less performance than half duplex and full duplex.                            | The Half Duplex mode provides less performance than full duplex.                                                               | Full Duplex provides better performance than simplex and half duplex mode.                                                        |
| 5.  | **Bandwidth** Utilization          | Simplex utilizes the maximum of a single bandwidth.                                                     | The Half-Duplex involves lesser utilization of single bandwidth at the time of transmission.                                   | The Full-Duplex doubles the utilization of transmission bandwidth.                                                                |
| 6.  | **Suitable** for                   | It is suitable for those transmissions when there is requirement of full bandwidth for delivering data. | It is suitable for those transmissions when there is requirement of sending data in both directions, but not at the same time. | It is suitable for those transmissions when there is requirement of sending and receiving data simultaneously in both directions. |
| 7.  | **Examples**                       | Example of simplex mode are: Keyboard and monitor.                                                      | Example of half duplex mode is: Walkie-Talkies.                                                                                | Example of full duplex mode is: Telephone.                                                                                        |
